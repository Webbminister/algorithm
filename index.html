   <!-- write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

 

Instructions
The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
 The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space). -->
<!-- The number of vowels in the sentence. -->
<!-- You have to keep in mind that:  -->

<!-- Each character will be treated separately. -->
<!-- The last character is the point. -->
<!-- Use three variables as counters.  -->

<!-- solution -->

<!--1. Initialize a variable to hold the characters of the sentence
2. Initialize an empty string to store the characters of the sentence
3. Initialize a variable that tracks the current position in the sentence
4. Start a loop that goes through each character in the sentence
5. Add the current character to the storage string
6. Check if the current character is a period (or ".")
7. exit the loop if condition is true
8. Move to the next character in the sentence
9. Repeat steps 4 to 7 until the end of the sentence is reached
